# ELIDEK--DB-project
This is a project for the Databases course. The purpose of this project is to create a SQL database, where the ELIDEK organisation will store data. Then we create a basic backend and frontend to perform queries on this data.
In the database we store information on:
-Projects of ELIDEK
-Organisations that manage projects
-Researchers
-Programs that finance the projects
-Research fields for the projects
-Managers
(see in Docs for more info)

Through the app a user can:
-filter the projects on start/end date, duration or manager
-see the projects on which a researcher is working
-the projects and researcher working on a specific field the last year
-
